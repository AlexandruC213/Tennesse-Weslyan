# Tennesse-Weslyan

This project is a full website of a highschool from USA, that was a challenge from a friend asking me if i can replicate it for a good practice.

This landing page was made with:
  - [html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
  - [css](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
  - [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
  - [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

 -  Beautiful website with some nice pages.
 -  Very good and long practice.
